Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

## Uses

- GPS: Find fastest route
- Network Routing: Finds shortest path for data
- Biology: Used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline tickets: finds cheapest route to your destination
- etc.
