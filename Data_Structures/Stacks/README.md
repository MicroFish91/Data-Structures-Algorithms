## Stacks

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

- Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
- Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.

Stacks are a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure.

Where stacks are used:

1. Function invocations
2. Undo/Redo
3. Routing History
   etc.

FOR SLL Implementation -
O(n):
Insertion: O(1); Removal: O(1); Searching: O(n), Access: O(n)
